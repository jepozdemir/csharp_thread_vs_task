![Thread vs Task in C#](/cover.png "Thread vs Task in C#")

This repository contains code samples and techniques referenced in my Medium blog post, ["Thread vs. Task in C#: What's the Difference?"](https://medium.com/@jepozdemir/thread-vs-task-in-c-whats-the-difference-48989517077a). This post and repository focus on the differences between `Thread` and `Task` in C#, their use cases, and practical guidance on when to use each.

## Overview
In this blog post, I explore the concepts of `Thread` and `Task` in C# and clarify when to use one over the other. Both `Thread` and `Task` are used for concurrent execution, but they are optimized for different scenarios, which this article and repository demonstrate with code examples.

### Topics Covered

- **What Is a Thread?**  
  Explanation of `Thread` as a lower-level construct for parallel execution and its manual control over execution.

- **What Is a Task?**  
  Explanation of `Task` as a higher-level abstraction over threads, optimized for managing asynchronous operations.

- **Differences Between Thread and Task**  
  Key differences, including:
  - Thread is lower-level and more resource-intensive.
  - Task is higher-level, often better for asynchronous programming and easier to manage.

- **Use Cases for Thread vs. Task**  
  Scenarios in which to prefer one over the other:
  - `Thread` for complex, low-level, or long-running parallel tasks.
  - `Task` for async operations, short-lived tasks, or when using async/await.

## How to Use
1. **Read the Blog Post**: Start by reading the full blog post on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@jepozdemir/thread-vs-task-in-c-whats-the-difference-48989517077a).
2. **Explore Code Samples**: Review the repository for code examples demonstrating the usage of `Thread` and `Task` in C#.
3. **Implement in Projects**: Use the provided examples to practice using threads and tasks in your own C# applications.
